# Port Scanning
First thing we gonna do if we are doing root on vulnerable machine is **scanning for the ports of victim's  machine**.

For port scanning, i have used `nmap` tools with the following command : 

```
# nmap -sC -sV -v 10.10.116.49
PORT     STATE    SERVICE   VERSION
80/tcp   open     http      Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET POST OPTIONS HEAD
| http-robots.txt: 2 disallowed entries 
|_/datacubes *
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition
5901/tcp open     vnc       VNC (protocol 3.8)
|_ssl-cert: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)![backbox-2022-10-25-15-01-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87742813/197804857-dd8e1776-a10a-4bdf-ab04-6d314acc579b.png)

|_ssl-date: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_sslv2: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
|_vnc-info: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)
7778/tcp filtered interwise
```
The scan identified ports 80, 5901, and 7778 as opens, indicating that the server has ***tcp***, ***vnc*** and ***http*** services running. We also noticed that on port 80, we are given hint which lead us to enumerate the robots.txt
